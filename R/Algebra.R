# Algebra

# If you are missing your phone, you can do calculations in R as well

365 * 24 * 60 * 60

# R outputs any calculations that you do if you don't follow with the assignments

sec_in_minute = 60
60 * sec_in_minute
sec_in_hour = 60 * sec_in_minute

# You can do + - / * % ^

# Order of operation matters 
10 + 5/5 - 2
(10 + 5)/(5 -2)

# Unlike oher programming languages, R can't do algebraic operations on strings, so
"I" + "am" + "great" # won't work - it would in Javascript, Ruby, c# etc.
